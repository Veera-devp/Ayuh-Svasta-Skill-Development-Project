# Ayuh-Svasta-Skill-Development-Project
As part of our studies, we worked on an Insurance Management System, which we termed "Ayuh Svasta," which means "Health and Life." We developed this project using the python stack of web development, which gave us a strong foundation in Django. 

# About Our Project

This Python Django-based online insurance administration system project focuses mostly on dealing with insurance policies. The system also shows all of the possible categories, along with their policies. Additionally, the system enables for the management of client records. This project is clearly separated into two sections: Customer and Admin Panel. In this online application's summary, a consumer may easily register and begin utilising it. Initially, the system displays all of the student's possible insurance coverage. He/she may, in fact, just apply for it. Each application, however, necessitates action from the administrator, which is contingent on their acceptance or disapproval. Every application will be marked as pending by default. In addition, the customer can view policy history and ask a number of queries, view the response from the admin.

# Policy Management, Admin Panel, and Insurance Category

An administrator, on the other hand, has complete control over the system. Unlike any other user, an admin controls the system's flow. The user may get a quick overview of each piece of information. The admin has the authority to accept or deny the customer's request for a policy. By the way, the system allows you to manage insurance categories simply by entering your name. Nonetheless, the administrator might continue to administer insurance policies. An administrator must supply data such as category, name, total money, premium, and tenure in order to create new policies. The user may, however, list out the records and make changes to them. Furthermore, the user can make a list of all accessible client records.
Aside from that, the system generates a list of overall records for all applicants in various sectors. Approved, refused, and pending holders are all included in this section. In addition, the administrator has the ability to manage inquiries.
